<h1 align="left">Hey there 👋, I'm Amos Babu</h1>
<p align="left">Full-stack dev by day 💻, keyboard ninja by night ⚡</p>

<p align="left">
   I'm a curious, code-slinging developer with a love for building cool stuff on the web. Whether it's APIs in Laravel, pixel-perfect UIs in React, or unleashing some Go magic, I’m all in. I like writing code that *works*, is clean, and sometimes even clever.
