<p align="center">Full-stack dev by day 💻, keyboard ninja by night ⚡</p>

<h1 align="center">💼 About Me</h1>

<p align="center">
   I'm a curious, code-slinging developer with a love for building cool stuff on the web. Whether it's APIs in Laravel, pixel-perfect UIs in React, or unleashing some Go magic, I’m all in. I like writing code that *works*, is clean, and sometimes even clever.
</p>

- 🚀 I build full-stack apps — from backend brains to frontend faces
- 🔐 JWT Auth? Real-time Chat? File Uploads? Done it ✔️
- 🐧 Dev on Linux (via WSL), build like a beast ⚒️
- 🧪 Currently playing with: Go, NLP, and custom Linux tooling
