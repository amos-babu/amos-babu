<h2 align="left">Hey there 👋, welcome</h2>
<p align="left">Full-stack dev by day 💻, keyboard ninja by night ⚡</p>

<p align="left">
   I'm an inquisitive developer who loves to create amazing things on the web.  I'm fine for using Laravel's APIs, React's pixel-perfect user interfaces, or using Go wizardry.  Writing code that *works*, is neat, and occasionally even ingenious is what I enjoy doing.
